# Semantic Duplicate & Near-Plagiarism Detection Engine

An educational, industry-inspired command line system for detecting duplicate, copied, and paraphrased documents. It implements and compares **two independent similarity-detection approaches, built entirely from scratch**:

1. **Shingling + MinHash + LSH** — documents are represented as sets of word $k$-shingles; Jaccard similarity is estimated via MinHash signatures and pruned via Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), so a large corpus never needs exhaustive pairwise comparison.
2. **TF-IDF weighted SimHash** — each document is reduced to a single 64-bit fingerprint; similarity is measured as a Hamming-distance bit-count.

No third-party MinHash/SimHash/LSH library (e.g. `datasketch`) is used for the core algorithms — only the Python standard library, NumPy, and Pandas. This is a **CLI-only** project: no graphical interface, no terminal UI.

## 📊 Results at a Glance

Validated on three datasets — a hand-curated document corpus, a synthetic labeled question-pair set, and the **real, 22,186-pair PAN-PC-11 plagiarism corpus**:

| Evaluation | Method | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Synthetic question pairs (60 pairs) | MinHash + LSH | 0.730 | 0.900 | 0.806 |
| Synthetic question pairs (60 pairs) | TF-IDF SimHash | 0.556 | 1.000 | 0.714 |
| Real PAN-PC-11 (4,000 pairs, tuned) | MinHash + LSH | 0.971 | 0.875 | **0.920** |
| Real PAN-PC-11 (4,000 pairs, tuned) | TF-IDF SimHash | 0.839 | 0.745 | 0.789 |

✅ Neither method is categorically better — SimHash wins on short questions, MinHash+LSH wins on long, heavily-obfuscated literary spans once the shingle size and decision threshold are tuned to the corpus. See `docs/project_spec.pdf`, Sections 5 and 7, for the full tuning story and an important caveat on the PAN-PC-11 numbers.

## ⚙️ Installation

**Requires Python 3.9+.**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

```bash
# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows (PowerShell / CMD)
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs the runtime dependencies (`numpy`, `pandas`, `click`), `pytest` for the test suite, and the `plagiarism_engine` package itself in editable mode. A console entry point `plagiarism-engine` is also installed; it is exactly equivalent to `python -m plagiarism_engine.cli`.


---

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Compare two documents directly
python -m plagiarism_engine.cli compare \
    --file-a data/sample_corpus/doc_01.txt --file-b data/sample_corpus/doc_02.txt

# 2. Search a folder for near-duplicates
python -m plagiarism_engine.cli corpus \
    --data data/sample_corpus --threshold 0.25 --output outputs/candidates.csv

# 3. Evaluate on a labeled pair dataset (bundled synthetic demo file)
python -m plagiarism_engine.cli pairs \
    --pairs data/raw/quora/sample_pairs.csv \
    --text-col-a question1 --text-col-b question2 --label-col is_duplicate \
    --shingle-size 1 --sweep --output outputs/metrics.csv
```

---

## 🖥️ Execution Instructions

The CLI exposes three commands: `compare`, `corpus`, and `pairs`.

### 1️⃣ `compare` — compare two documents

```bash
python -m plagiarism_engine.cli compare \
    --file-a data/sample_corpus/doc_01.txt \
    --file-b data/sample_corpus/doc_02.txt \
    --output outputs/two_file_compare.json
```

Prints exact Jaccard similarity, the MinHash-estimated similarity, whether the pair would be flagged as an LSH candidate, and the SimHash Hamming distance/similarity, and (optionally) writes a JSON report.

### 2️⃣ `corpus` — search a folder for near-duplicate documents

```bash
python -m plagiarism_engine.cli corpus \
    --data data/sample_corpus \
    --threshold 0.25 \
    --shingle-size 3 \
    --output outputs/candidates.csv
```

Builds a MinHash+LSH index over every `*.txt` file in `--data`, uses LSH to cut the number of expensive exact-Jaccard comparisons down from the full O(n²) pair set to just the LSH candidate pairs, verifies each candidate with exact Jaccard, and writes the pairs at or above `--threshold` to `--output`. Prints a summary of how many comparisons LSH avoided (94.55% on the bundled sample corpus).

### 3️⃣ `pairs` — evaluate on a labeled pair dataset

```bash
python -m plagiarism_engine.cli pairs \
    --pairs data/raw/quora/sample_pairs.csv \
    --text-col-a question1 \
    --text-col-b question2 \
    --label-col is_duplicate \
    --limit 5000 \
    --output outputs/metrics.csv
```

Runs **both** backends over every row of a labeled pair CSV (Quora Question Pairs, Stack Exchange Duplicates, a PAN-PC-11-derived pair list — see [below](#-using-the-real-pan-pc-11-corpus) — or the small synthetic demo file shipped at `data/raw/quora/sample_pairs.csv`) and reports precision, recall, F1, and execution time for each, written to `--output`.

💡 Similarity-score distributions vary a lot by document length and by how heavily a dataset's positive pairs are paraphrased/obfuscated, so a fixed decision threshold tuned for one dataset can perform very poorly on another — high precision with collapsed recall is the signature of this, not necessarily a broken similarity measure (see `docs/project_spec.pdf`, Section 5.6). Add `--sweep` to have each method's threshold chosen automatically to maximize F1 on the given dataset instead of guessing (this costs almost nothing extra — similarity scores are computed once and swept cheaply); add `--sweep-output <path>` to also save the full threshold/precision/recall/F1 curve.

ℹ️ Run `python -m plagiarism_engine.cli <command> --help` for the full list of tunable options (shingle size, number of MinHash permutations, number of LSH bands, SimHash bit width, decision thresholds, etc.) on any command.

## 📚 Using the Real PAN-PC-11 Corpus

`scripts/prepare_pan_pc11_pairs.py` converts a locally-downloaded copy of the real PAN-PC-11 corpus (raw documents + XML plagiarism annotations, [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/3250095)) into a `pairs`-compatible CSV, with no changes needed to `src/plagiarism_engine/`:

### 1. Confirm the annotation schema against your actual download:
```bash
python scripts/prepare_pan_pc11_pairs.py \
    --corpus-dir data/raw/pan-plagiarism-corpus-2011/external-detection-corpus --inspect
```

### 2. Build the labeled pairs CSV:
```bash
python scripts/prepare_pan_pc11_pairs.py \
    --corpus-dir data/raw/pan-plagiarism-corpus-2011/external-detection-corpus \
    --output data/processed/pan_pc11_pairs.csv --feature-name plagiarism
```

### 3. Evaluate (k=1 recommended — see docs/project_spec.pdf, Section 5.7, for why):
```bash
python -m plagiarism_engine.cli pairs \
    --pairs data/processed/pan_pc11_pairs.csv \
    --text-col-a text_a --text-col-b text_b --label-col label \
    --shingle-size 1 --sweep --output outputs/metrics_pan_pc11.csv
```

See `data/raw/README.md` for the full walkthrough, the confirmed real directory layout, and a documented limitation of this dataset construction (length mismatch between positive and negative pairs).

## 🔬 Method Summary

| | 🧩 Shingling + MinHash + LSH | 🔢 TF-IDF weighted SimHash |
|---|---|---|
| **Document representation** | Set of word $k$-shingles | Weighted bag of tokens |
| **Similarity signal** | Jaccard similarity (exact or estimated) | Hamming distance between 64-bit fingerprints |
| **Sensitive to** | Exact wording / word order | Vocabulary overlap (order-independent) |
| **Scales via** | LSH banding (skip most pairwise comparisons) | O(1) fingerprint comparison per pair |
| **Strength** | Robust when edits are concentrated (verbatim / lightly-edited copies) | Robust to reordering; strong on very short text |
| **Weakness** | Struggles when edits are scattered throughout a long passage, unless $k$ is reduced | Still lexical, not truly semantic; sensitive to vocabulary swaps |

📄 See `docs/project_spec.pdf` for the full write-up: why exact pairwise Jaccard comparison is O(n²), how LSH's banding scheme trades off false positives/negatives, parameter selection for both pipelines (including the automatic threshold-sweep methodology), and a worked error analysis of specific misclassified pairs from both the synthetic and real-corpus experiments.

## 📝 Summary
This project implements a semantic plagiarism and near-duplicate detection engine using two independent approaches: Shingling + MinHash + LSH and TF-IDF weighted SimHash.  
It evaluates the methods on small curated documents, synthetic labeled pairs, and the PAN-PC-11 plagiarism corpus using precision, recall, F1-score, and runtime metrics.  
The report compares the strengths, limitations, and failure cases of both pipelines in detecting exact, near-exact, and paraphrased textual similarity.
